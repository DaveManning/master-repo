    "These outputs make sense: the head matches the attached CSV preview; the top- and bottom-cost lists are consistent with the data, and the environment currently rejects statsmodels due to a SciPy internal API change, so I fell back to sklearn for linear OLS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Who differs the most\n",

    "### Why the differences (drivers)\n",

    "\n",
    "- Fuel_Cost: High fuel costs push total Cost up. Puget’s cost is high even with modest Fuel_Cost, while Oklahoma’s Fuel_Cost is moderate-to-low. In general across the dataset, companies with higher Fuel_Cost trend higher in Cost.\n",
    "- Nuclear: Higher nuclear share often lowers marginal generation costs. Northern States Power has high nuclear share and high Cost, suggesting other factors (like Fuel_Cost or capital-related items) can offset nuclear benefits.\n",
    "- Load_factor: Higher load factor usually spreads fixed costs over more kWh, lowering average Cost. Low load factor tends to increase Cost.\n",
    "- Fixed_charge and Rate_of_Return: These reflect capital recovery and allowed returns; higher values can raise average Cost if the asset base is large or utilization is lower.\n",
    "- Sales and Demand_growth: Larger sales volumes generally help dilute fixed costs, while weak sales growth or small scale can elevate average Cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it together for the extremes:\n",
    "- Puget vs. Oklahoma:\n",
    "  - Puget’s high Cost aligns with a combination of moderate Fuel_Cost, moderate load factor, and likely higher effective capital burden per kWh (given Fixed_charge/scale), whereas\n",
    "  - Oklahoma’s low Cost coincides with lower Fuel_Cost, a leaner capital burden per kWh, and reasonable scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’d like, I can:\n",
    "- Run a clean OLS using sklearn’s LinearRegression now (since statsmodels import is blocked) to quantify each driver’s coefficient, plus a quick bar plot of standardized coefficients.\n",
